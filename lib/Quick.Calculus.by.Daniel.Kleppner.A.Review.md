Quick Calculus was first published in 1965[^3^] and has been updated several times since then. The latest edition, published in 2021[^1^], features new sections, rewritten introductions, and worked examples that show how to apply calculus concepts to problems in physics, health sciences, engineering, statistics, and other core sciences.
 
The book covers topics such as functions, limits, derivatives, applications of differentiation, integration, applications of integration, techniques of integration, infinite series, and differential equations. Each chapter begins with a summary of the main ideas and formulas, followed by a set of exercises with solutions. The book also includes appendices on trigonometric functions, logarithms and exponentials, complex numbers, and numerical methods.
 
Quick Calculus is not a comprehensive textbook on calculus, but rather a supplement or a refresher for students who have some background in algebra and geometry. It assumes that you have some familiarity with mathematical notation and symbols, but it does not require any prior knowledge of calculus. The book is written in a friendly and informal tone, with plenty of examples and explanations to help you grasp the concepts.
 
Whether you are preparing for an exam, brushing up on your skills, or just curious about calculus, Quick Calculus can help you learn the essentials of this fascinating subject. You can find the book online or at your local bookstore. You can also download a PDF version of the book for free from the Internet Archive[^2^].
